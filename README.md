# AE-Sort-Layers-Screen-Position
Dockable After Effects ScriptUI panel to sort selected layers by on-screen (comp-space) X/Y position using toComp(). Includes stable sorting, tie tolerance, bounds-center sampling for text/shape layers, and a “primary-bucket” mode to preserve stacking (ideal for charts/stacked bars).
